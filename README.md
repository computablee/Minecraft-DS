## This project will be deleted soon!

Due to GitHub's unfortunate new practice of using repositories to train Microsoft LLMs, I have made the difficult decision to migrate all of my projects to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).

Because of this project's low visibility, I have decided that it is not important enough to keep on GitHub.
**Therefore, I have decided to delete this project at some point during the month of September.**
